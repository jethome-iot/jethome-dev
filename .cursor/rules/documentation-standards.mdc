2. Table of current images with links
3. Generic quick start
4. Project structure diagram
5. Registry information
6. License

## Image READMEs

Must be:
- **Comprehensive**: All details about the image
- **Accurate**: No misleading claims
- **Practical**: Real-world usage examples

Required sections:
