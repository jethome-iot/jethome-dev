# Documentation Standards

## Root README

Must be:
- **Generic**: Suitable for multi-image architecture
- **Minimal**: Brief overview, not detailed
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new images

Structure:
1. Brief project description
2. Table of current images with links
3. Generic quick start
4. Project structure diagram
5. Registry information
6. License

## Image READMEs

Must be:
- **Comprehensive**: All details about the image
- **Accurate**: No misleading claims
- **Practical**: Real-world usage examples
- **Image-Focused**: About using the image, not framework tutorials

**Important:** READMEs should focus on **how to use the Docker image**, not **how to develop with the framework inside it**. See [Image README Standards](image-readme-standards.mdc) for detailed guidelines.

Required sections:
1. Overview
2. What's Inside (specific versions)
3. Quick Start
4. Usage Examples (Docker commands, CI/CD integration)
5. Environment Variables
6. Building the Image
7. Version Information table

Sections to AVOID:
- Framework tutorials (create project, configure, etc.)
- Development workflows (step-by-step guides)
- Code examples (framework-specific code)
- Feature explanations (framework features, not image features)
- Troubleshooting (users can refer to upstream documentation)
- Design Decisions (keep documentation focused on usage)

## Accuracy Rules

- Only document what's actually in the Dockerfile
- Clearly state what downloads at runtime vs pre-installed
- Include actual version numbers
- Never claim features that aren't implemented
