# Documentation Standards

## README File Guidelines

### Root README.md

The root [README.md](mdc:README.md) must be:
- **Generic**: Suitable for multi-image architecture
- **Minimal**: Brief overview, not detailed
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new images (just add row to table)
- **Clear**: Simple quick start examples

**Structure:**
1. Brief project description
2. Table of current images with links
3. Generic quick start
4. Project structure diagram
5. Registry information
6. License

### Image-Specific READMEs

Each image's README (e.g., [images/platformio/README.md](mdc:images/platformio/README.md)) must be:
- **Comprehensive**: All details about the image
- **Accurate**: No misleading claims
- **Practical**: Real-world usage examples
- **Complete**: Troubleshooting section

**Required Sections:**
1. Overview
2. What's Inside (specific versions and tools)
3. Quick Start (pull, build, run commands)
4. Supported Hardware/Platforms (if applicable)
5. Usage Examples (basic commands, CI/CD integration)
6. Configuration Examples
7. Environment Variables
8. Building the Image (local build instructions)
9. Troubleshooting (common issues and solutions)
10. Design Decisions (explain architectural choices)
11. Version Information (table with versions)
12. License
13. Related Links

## Documentation Accuracy

**Critical Rules:**
- ✅ Only document what's actually in the Dockerfile
- ✅ Clearly state what downloads at runtime vs pre-installed
- ✅ Include actual version numbers from build args
- ✅ Explain disabled features (commented code)
- ❌ Never claim features that aren't implemented
- ❌ Don't use aspirational language for missing features

## Style Guide

- Use clear, simple language
- Include code examples for all commands
- Use tables for structured data (versions, hardware support)
- Add notes/warnings where needed
- Link to official documentation for external tools
