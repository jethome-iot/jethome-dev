# Adding New Docker Images

## Workflow

1. **Create Dockerfile** - Write and refine the Dockerfile
2. **Build Locally** - Build and test the image thoroughly
3. **Generate Documentation** - Only after successful build, create README

## Directory Structure

Create new directory: `images/<image-name>/` containing:
- `Dockerfile` - Image definition
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation
- Supporting files as needed

## Dockerfile Requirements

- Base image with version
- Build arguments for version pinning
- Environment variables for tool paths
- Working directory `/workspace`
- Verification step
- Layer optimization (combine RUN commands, cleanup)

## README Requirements

Image README must include:
- Overview and description
- What's Inside (specific versions)
- Quick Start (pull, build, run)
- Usage Examples
- CI/CD Integration examples
- Environment Variables
- Building the Image

- Version Information table

## Update Root README

Add new image to the table in root README. Keep it minimal - just image name, brief description, and link.

## Registry Naming

Images published as: `ghcr.io/jethome-iot/jethome-dev-<image-name>`

## Testing

Before committing:
- Build locally and verify functionality
- Test all README examples
- Check image size is reasonable
