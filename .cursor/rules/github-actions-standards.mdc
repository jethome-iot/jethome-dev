# GitHub Actions Standards

## Workflow Naming

Use emoji icons for better visibility:

```yaml
name: 🐳 Docker Build Workflow
```

Common icons:
- 🐳 Docker builds
- 🔧 Build/compile
- 🧪 Testing
- 📦 Package/release
- 🚀 Deployment

## Step Icons

Add emoji to step names for readability:

- 📥 Checkout code
- 🔧 Setup/configure tools
- 🔐 Authentication
- 🐳 Docker operations
- 🧪 Run tests
- 🚀 Deploy

## Per-Image Workflows

Each image should have its own workflow file:
- Naming: `.github/workflows/<image-name>.yml`
- Trigger on relevant file changes only
- Use branch-based tagging (dev, latest, stable)
- Use reusable workflow: `.github/workflows/reusable-docker-build.yml`

## Local Testing

Test workflows locally using `act`:
- Configuration in `.actrc`
- Test specific job: `act -j build`
- Use `.secrets` file for local secrets (gitignored)
