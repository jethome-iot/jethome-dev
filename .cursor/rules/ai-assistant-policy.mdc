# AI Assistant Policy

## File Modifications

**âœ… AUTOMATIC FILE MODIFICATIONS ALLOWED**

AI assistants have permission to:
- Create new files
- Modify existing files
- Delete files
- Refactor code
- Update documentation
- Make any necessary changes to complete tasks

**No extra confirmation required** - proceed directly with file operations to save time.

## Commit Policy

**ðŸš« NEVER AUTO-COMMIT**

While file modifications are unrestricted, commits remain user-controlled:
- AI assistants must NEVER commit changes automatically
- AI assistants must NEVER use `git commit` without explicit user confirmation
- Only the USER decides when to commit
- USER must review and approve all commits

## Workflow

1. AI makes all necessary file changes
2. AI presents summary of changes
3. USER reviews changes
4. USER decides when to commit

This separation allows:
- Fast iteration on files
- User control over git history
- Time savings on routine modifications
- Deliberate commit points chosen by user
