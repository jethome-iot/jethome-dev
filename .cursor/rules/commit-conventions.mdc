# Git Commit Conventions

## Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages that explain **what** and **why**.

```
<Brief summary line>

- Detailed point 1
- Detailed point 2
- Detailed point 3
```

Good: `Add new development image` with detailed list
Bad: `Update files`, `Fix`, `WIP`, `changes`

## AI/Cursor Commit Policy

**ðŸš« NEVER AUTO-COMMIT**

- AI assistants must NEVER commit changes automatically
- AI assistants must NEVER use `git commit` without explicit user confirmation
- Only the USER decides when to commit
- USER must review and approve all commits

## Branch Strategy

- **dev** - Development work, testing
- **master** - Stable releases only
- Feature branches - For experimental work

## Commit Grouping

Group related changes in single commit:
- Dockerfile + README for same feature
- All files needed for new image

Keep separate:
- Don't mix unrelated changes
- Don't combine feature + bugfix
- Don't combine multiple images in one commit
